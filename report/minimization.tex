Submodular function minimization can be divided into two categories, exact and approximate algorithms. Exact algorithms obtain global minimizers for a problem whereas approximate algorithms only achieve an approximate solution i.e for a set $X$ the solution $f(X) - \underset{Y \subset V}{\operatorname{min }}\text{ } f(Y) \leq \epsilon $, where $\epsilon$ is as small as possible. If $\epsilon$ is less than the minimum absolute difference between non equal values of $f$, the solution computed corresponds to the exact solution.

An important practical aspect of submodular function minimization is that most algorithms come with online approximation guarantees {\it due to a duality relationship}, which we will detail in the following subsections.\\

\subsubsection{\bf Submodular Function Minimizers}
For the lemmas stated below, we consider $f$ to be a submodular function where $\{f:2^V \rightarrow \Re \mid f(\emptyset) = 0\}$.\\

\begin{itemize}
 \item {\bf \lemma (Lattice of minimizers for submodular functions)}: The set of minimizers of $f$ is a lattice, i.e if $X$ and $Y$ are minimizers then $X\cup Y$ and $X \cap Y$ are also minimizers. This is evident from {\bf Definition 1} and {\bf Lemma 1.1}\\

 \item {\bf \lemma (Diminishing return property of minimizers of submodular functions)}: The set $X \subset V$ is a minimizer of $f$ on $2^V$ iff $X$ is a minimizer of $2^X \rightarrow \Re$ defined as $Y \subset X \rightarrow f(Y)$ and if $\emptyset$ is a minimizer of the function from $2^{V\setminus X} \rightarrow \Re$  then it is defined as $Y \subset V\setminus X \rightarrow f(Y \cup X) - f(X)$ . This can be easily shown from {\bf Definition 1}.\\
 
  {\it Corollary 6.1 : (Norm Characterization)}: Suppose $\hat{x}$ is a minimizer of 
 \[
  \underset{x}{\operatorname{min }}\text{ } \| x\|_2^2 \text{ subject to } x\in B(f)
 \]
 Then a minimizer $A$ for $f$ can be obtained as follows:
 \[
   A = \{ u \in V \mid \hat{x}(u) \leq 0\}
 \]

  \item{\bf \lemma (Dual of minimization of submodular functions)}: \[ \underset{X \subset V}{\operatorname{min }}\text{ } f(X) =  \underset{x \in B(f) }{\operatorname{max }}\text{ } x^-(V) = f(V) - \underset{x \in B(f) }{\operatorname{min }}\text{ } \|x\| \]
  As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:notation} $(x^-)_k = min\{x_k,0\} \text{ } \forall k \in V$. If $X \subset V$ and $x \in B(f)$, we have $f(X) \geq x^-(V)$ with equality iff $\{ x < 0 \} \subset X \subset \{ x\leq 0\}$ and $x(X) = f(X)$. \\
  \[
   \underset{X \subset V}{\operatorname{min }}\text{ } f(X) =  \underset{x \in P(f), x\leq 0 }{\operatorname{max }}\text{ } x(V)
  \]
  Again if $X\subset V$ and $x\in P(f) \mid x \leq 0$, then $f(X) \geq x(V)$ iff $\{x \leq 0 \} \subset X$ and $s(X) = f(x)$.\\

\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Minimum Norm Point Algorithm}
As an example of Submodular function minimization we present the minimum norm point algorithm. A non combinatorial approach proposed by Fujishige \cite{Fujishige} is based on the norm characterization of the minima of f shown in {\bf Lemma 2.2}. Fujishige uses Wolfe's algorithm \cite{Wolfe} which was developed to minimize the $L_2$ norm of a vector in a convex hull of a finite set of points $P \in \Re^n$. This method maintains the vector $x$ as a convex combination of points $S$ and iterates over the following steps.\\
\begin{itemize}
 \item {\bf 1}: A new point from $P$ with a norm with respect to $x$ is added to to set $S$.
 \item {\bf 2}: A point with the minimum norm $x$ is computed in the affine hull of $S$.
 \item {\bf 3}: The minimum norm point $x$ is projected onto the convex hull of $S$. 
\end{itemize}

In the case of submodular functions one needs to search through the set of all bases $P$ which is exponential in size. This issue is circumvented by using Edmonds Greedy Algorithm \cite{Edmond}.\\
